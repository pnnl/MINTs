MINTs documentation
===================

Welcome to the Material Inventory and Nuclear Tracking simulator (MINTs) documentation page.

The repository is divided into subpackages for `facilities`, `fuel_cycles`, and `util`, and includes submodules for `containers` 
(implementations of the Material Balance Areas (MBAs) in the simulation), and `resouces` (items and material types used in the fuel cycle simulations).
